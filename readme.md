# Yet another _Advent of Code_ repo

My personal, public [AoC](https://duckduckgo.com) repo.

## Description

The code shared on here is _not_ meant as a portfolio

I am using it as a tool to assist in conversations with friends and colleagues, and/or to practice particular methods.

2024 + python is mostly about testing how various TDD choices result in different outcomes. As I am not publishing anything with empirical value, those notes are not in this repo.
